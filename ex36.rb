Now write a similar game to the one that I created in the last exercise. It can be any kind of game you want in the same flavor. Spend a week on it making it as interesting as possible. For extra credit, use arrays, functions, and modules (remember those from Ex. 13?) as much as possible, and find as many new pieces of Ruby as you can to make the game work.

There is one catch though, write up your idea for the game first. Before you start coding you must write up a map for your game. Create the rooms, monsters, and traps that the player must go through on paper before you code.

Once you have your map, try to code it up. If you find problems with the map then adjust it and make the code match.

One final word of advice: Every programmer becomes paralyzed by irrational fear starting a new large project. They then use procrastination to avoid confronting this fear and end up not getting their program working or even started. I do this. Everyone does this. The best way to avoid this is to make a list of things you should do, and then do them one at a time.

Just start doing it, do a small version, make it bigger, keep a list of things to do, and do them.
